## 📖 Lessons Learned

### Day 1: Pathlib vs. Raw Strings
* **Raw Strings:** Treating a file path or name as a pure string limits flexibility and can break across different operating systems.
* **Path Objects:** Using `pathlib.Path` converts a string into a "smart object," allowing dynamic properties access.

### Day 2: Anatomy of a Path File
When working with pipeline assets (like textures or automation files), `pathlib` makes it incredibly easy to dissect a file's name properties without messy string splitting:
* **`.name`**: Returns the complete filename including the extension (e.g., `ground_mud_01_diffuse.png`).
* **`.stem`**: Extracts the pure file name *without* the extension (e.g., `ground_mud_01_diffuse`). Perfect for naming output logs or derivative assets.
* **`.suffix`**: Returns only the file extension type including the dot (e.g., `.png`). Great for filtering files in an automation pipeline.
