## 📖 Lessons Learned

### Day 1: Pathlib vs. Raw Strings
* **Raw Strings:** Treating a file path or name as a pure string limits flexibility and can break across different operating systems.
* **Path Objects:** Using `pathlib.Path` converts a string into a "smart object," allowing dynamic properties access.

### Day 2: Anatomy of a Path File
When working with pipeline assets, `pathlib` makes it easy to dissect a file's name properties without messy string splitting:
* **`.name`**: Returns the complete filename including the extension.
* **`.stem`**: Extracts the pure file name *without* the extension.
* **`.suffix`**: Returns only the file extension type including the dot.

### Day 3: Traversing Directory Trees
When managing complex game dev asset structures (e.g., Unreal Engine or Unity content folders), you frequently need to find where an asset sits relative to its project environment. `pathlib` handles tree traversal cleanly through property chaining:
* **`.parent`**: Retrieves the full path of the immediate directory enclosing the asset.
* **`.parent.parent`**: Traverses up another tier to get the grandparent folder path.
* **`.parent.name`**: Isolates just the string name of the parent folder itself, completely discarding the preceding system paths. This is incredibly useful for auto-assigning categories or grouping assets by their folder context.
